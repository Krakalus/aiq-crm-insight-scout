# üöÄ AIQ CRM Insight Scout

## Revolutionize CRM with Agentic AI Precision

Welcome to **AIQ CRM Insight Scout**, a cutting-edge AI-powered CRM assistant crafted for a hackathon to master *Agentic AI* in Customer Relationship Management (CRM). This solution harnesses advanced AI to process legal and operational documents, enabling seamless **contract management**, **compliance**, and **customer support automation**. Born from a bold vision to innovate in the CRM industry, this project blends determination with innovation to deliver impactful results for hackathon success!

> [!NOTE]  
> First runs may take 15-20s to build the FAISS index. Subsequent queries average 13-15s, optimized for `top_k=3` document retrieval. Focus on the custom `(Time: X.Xs)` output for accurate timing.

## Why AIQ CRM Insight Scout?

- **Agentic AI Powerhouse**: Automates complex CRM tasks like contract analysis and compliance checks with a stateful LangGraph workflow.
- **CRM-Focused Innovation**: Tackles real-world challenges‚Äîmanaging *Data Processing Addendums*, *Terms of Service*, and regulatory compliance (e.g., CCPA, EAR).
- **Interactive Demo**: A sleek Gradio UI delivers fast, precise answers with processing time metrics, perfect for CRM teams.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üìö Robust Document Corpus**: Processes 9 markdown files (contracts, invoices, compliance checklists) simulating real CRM data.
- **ü§ñ Intelligent AI Agent**: Retrieves top 3 documents via FAISS, processes with NVIDIA‚Äôs *Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Nano-8B-v1*, and delivers intent-based answers or summaries.
- **üñ•Ô∏è User-Friendly UI**: Gradio interface with clear *Answer*, *Plan*, and *Documents Retrieved* sections, including live processing time (e.g., `(Time: 14.3s)`).
- **‚öñÔ∏è Compliance Ready**: Handles US regulations (*CCPA*, *EAR*, *FTC Act*) for precise legal and operational insights.
- **‚ö° Optimized Performance**: Caches embeddings with `@lru_cache` and limits retrieval to `top_k=3` for fast, relevant responses.

## üéØ Motivation

This project was born to:
- **Master Agentic AI**: Explore autonomous task handling for CRM automation.
- **Solve CRM Challenges**: Streamline legal document management and ensure compliance with laws like *CCPA* and *EAR*.
- **Impress at the Hackathon**: Build a demo showcasing practical AI integration, proving its value in the CRM industry.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Journey

### Initial Setup
- **Backend**: FastAPI with LangGraph for stateful agent workflows (*plan*, *retrieve*, *output*).
- **AI Stack**: NVIDIA NIM API for embeddings (`nv-embedqa-e5-v5`) and LLM (`llama-3.1-nemotron-nano-8b-v1`) via OpenAI client.
- **Frontend**: Gradio UI for interactive query handling.
- **Retrieval**: FAISS for efficient document search.

### Challenges & Solutions
| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| **Embedding Generation** | Cached embeddings with `@lru_cache` and increased API timeout handling. |
| **Response Time (13-15s)** | Set `top_k=3` for focused retrieval; optimized FAISS indexing. |
| **Confusing Gradio UI** | Added custom `(Time: X.Xs)` to output; attempted `_js` override (failed due to TypeError). |
| **Document Management** | Expanded corpus to 9 files; removed stale `faiss_index.bin` for fresh indexing. |

## üíª Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Python**: 3.8+
- **pip**: Python package manager
- **Hardware**: GPU recommended for NVIDIA NIM API (e.g., 1x H100 80GB or equivalent for local LLM inference).

### Setup Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <repo-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Create a virtual environment (optional):
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - Install packages:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - **Note**: If prompted to update pip (e.g., "A new release of pip is available: 25.1.1 -> 25.2"), run:
     ```bash
     python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
     ```

3. **Configure Environment**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
     ```
     NVIDIA_API_KEY=your_nvidia_api_key_here
     ```
   - Obtain your key from [NVIDIA API Catalog](https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/).

4. **Prepare Data**:
   - Ensure `../data/` contains these 9 markdown files:
     - `xAI_Service_Agreement_Revised.markdown`
     - `xAI_Invoice_Revised.markdown`
     - `xAI_Business_Proposal_Revised.markdown`
     - `Customer_Feedback_Survey.markdown`
     - `Performance_Report_Template.markdown`
