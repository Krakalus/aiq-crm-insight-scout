üöÄ AIQ CRM Insight Scout
Revolutionize CRM with Agentic AI Precision
Welcome to AIQ CRM Insight Scout, an AI-powered CRM assistant crafted for a hackathon to master Agentic AI in Customer Relationship Management (CRM). This solution harnesses cutting-edge AI to process legal and operational documents, enabling seamless contract management, compliance, and customer support automation. Born from a bold vision to innovate in the CRM industry, this project blends desperation with determination to deliver impactful results for hackathon success!
üåü Why AIQ CRM Insight Scout?

Agentic AI Powerhouse: Automates complex CRM tasks like contract analysis and compliance checks with a stateful LangGraph workflow.
CRM-Focused Innovation: Tackles real-world challenges‚Äîmanaging Data Processing Addendums, Terms of Service, and regulatory compliance (e.g., CCPA, EAR).
Interactive Demo: A sleek Gradio UI delivers fast, precise answers with processing time metrics, perfect for CRM teams.


[!NOTE]First runs may take 15-20s to build the FAISS index. Subsequent queries average 13-15s, optimized for top_k=3 document retrieval. Focus on the custom (Time: X.Xs) output for accurate timing.

‚ú® Key Features

üìö Robust Document Corpus: Processes 9 markdown files (contracts, invoices, compliance checklists) simulating real CRM data.
ü§ñ Intelligent AI Agent: Retrieves top 3 documents via FAISS, processes with NVIDIA‚Äôs Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Nano-8B-v1, and delivers intent-based answers or summaries.
üñ•Ô∏è User-Friendly UI: Gradio interface with clear "Answer," "Plan," and "Documents Retrieved" sections, including live processing time (e.g., (Time: 14.3s)).
‚öñÔ∏è Compliance Ready: Handles US regulations (CCPA, EAR, FTC Act) for precise legal and operational insights.
‚ö° Optimized Performance: Caches embeddings with @lru_cache and limits retrieval to top_k=3 for fast, relevant responses.

üéØ Motivation
This project was born to:

Master Agentic AI: Explore autonomous task handling for CRM automation.
Solve CRM Challenges: Streamline legal document management and ensure compliance with laws like CCPA and EAR.
Impress at the Hackathon: Build a demo showcasing practical AI integration, proving its value in the CRM industry.

üõ†Ô∏è Development Journey
Initial Setup

Backend: FastAPI with LangGraph for stateful agent workflows (plan, retrieve, output).
AI Stack: NVIDIA NIM API for embeddings (nv-embedqa-e5-v5) and LLM (llama-3.1-nemotron-nano-8b-v1) via OpenAI client.
Frontend: Gradio UI for interactive query handling.
Retrieval: FAISS for efficient document search.

Challenges & Solutions



Challenge
Solution



Embedding Generation
Cached embeddings with @lru_cache and increased API timeout handling.


Response Time (13-15s)
Set top_k=3 for focused retrieval; optimized FAISS indexing.


Confusing Gradio UI
Added custom (Time: X.Xs) to output; attempted _js override (failed due to TypeError).


Document Management
Expanded corpus to 9 files; removed stale faiss_index.bin for fresh indexing.


üíª Installation
Prerequisites

Python: 3.8+
pip: Python package manager
Hardware: GPU recommended for NVIDIA NIM API (e.g., 1x H100 80GB or equivalent for local LLM inference).

Setup Steps

Clone the Repository:
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <repo-directory>


Install Dependencies:

Create a virtual environment (optional):python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install packages:pip install -r requirements.txt


Note: If prompted to update pip (e.g., "A new release of pip is available: 25.1.1 -> 25.2"), run:python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip




Configure Environment:

Create a .env file in the root directory:NVIDIA_API_KEY=your_nvidia_api_key_here


Obtain your key from NVIDIA API Catalog.


Prepare Data:

Ensure ../data/ contains these 9 markdown files:
xAI_Service_Agreement_Revised.markdown
xAI_Invoice_Revised.markdown
xAI_Business_Proposal_Revised.markdown
Customer_Feedback_Survey.markdown
Performance_Report_Template.markdown
Project_Timeline.markdown
xAI_Data_Processing_Addendum.markdown
xAI_Terms_of_Service.markdown
xAI_Compliance_Checklist.markdown




Run the Application:
python app.py


Access the Gradio UI at http://localhost:8000/.



üöÄ Usage
Interface

Enter Query: Input a question (e.g., "What is the due date for the xAI invoice?") in the "Enter Query" textbox.
Submit: Click the "Submit" button to process.
Output:
Answer: Displays the response with processing time (e.g., "November 4, 2025 (Time: 14.3s)").
Plan: Shows the agent‚Äôs planning step.
Documents Retrieved: Indicates number of documents used (typically 3).



üîç Example Queries
